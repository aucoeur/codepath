# Summer Technical Interview Prep Course Overview (Advanced)

## **Purpose**

This 12-week virtual course will help you ace technical interviews preparing you to solve challenging algorithm problems in real whiteboard interviews at top companies.

- Lectures and algorithm labs
- Interview practice
- Tools and techniques for problem solving
- Mentorship from industry professionals
- Info sessions from experienced engineers
- Resume feedback & internship search support

## **Prerequisites**

* Must have taken at least one basic programming course and an algorithms and data structures course.
* Mandatory attendance for the weekly virtual sessions with 3 excused absences.
* Can dedicate 10+ hours a week to the course and assignment work for 12 weeks

## **Program Structure**

* Meets twice a week for 2 hour sessions in virtual classroom
* Weekly exercises to complete before and after the sessions
* Sessions begin in June and end in August

## **Topics covered**

Topics introduced are focused on technical interviewing and practical fundamentals of software development including:

* Behavioral and general interviewing tips
* Practical data structures
* Implementing efficient algorithms

Over the 12-weeks, the following topics will be highlighted:

* Core data structures: Hash Tables, Arrays, Linked Lists
* Complex data structures: Binary Trees, Heaps
* Object Oriented Design/Systems Design
* Searches: Binary Search, Breadth First Search/Depth First Search
* Sorting: Merge Sort and Quick Sort
* Recursion and Combinations
* Dynamic Programming
* Greedy Algorithms

The course will also include a preview of real-world software engineering roles and challenges including:

* Fireside Q&A chats and info sessions with professional engineers
* Industry mentors helping with mock interviews
* Learn what it's like in the day-to-day of different software engineering roles
* What are the common challenges faced in your first full-time software role
